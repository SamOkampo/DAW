# Phase 10 Status — Production Editing / Mixer / Browser / Workflow

**Status: IN PROGRESS**

Phase 10 turns the broad production feature set completed through Phase 9 into a faster, clearer day-to-day music-production workflow. Work stays incremental: one bounded subpoint per branch/PR, green CI before merge, and no convenience feature may weaken the realtime contract.

## 10.1 — Arrangement editing

Planned sequence:
1. Establish explicit Arrangement selection state and predictable click-to-select behavior.
2. Add bounded multi-selection/edit operations without changing the project schema unless persistence is actually required.
3. Improve timeline navigation, zoom/scroll and musical snapping using existing 960 PPQ timing.
4. Refine clip/pattern manipulation feedback and Undo/Redo coverage.

## 10.2 — Mixer production workflow

- Clarify Track / Bus / Master channel-strip hierarchy and active target state.
- Make routing, sends and plugin-rack operations easier to inspect and edit.
- Preserve the existing immutable realtime routing/plugin graph and PDC behavior.

## 10.3 — Browser production workflow

- Add safe sample preview and faster navigation on top of the Phase 9 Browser.
- Keep filesystem traversal, decoding and preview preparation off the audio callback.
- Preserve the existing project import route and bounded machine-local history.

## 10.4 — Piano Roll / Sequencer workflow

- Improve selection and common musical editing operations.
- Keep edits command/Undo based and preserve deterministic timing/groove behavior.

## 10.5 — Plugin workflow

- Improve plugin discovery presentation, search/selection and rack ergonomics.
- Discovery, instantiation, editor/state work and failure handling remain outside the realtime callback.
- Preserve backend-neutral project state and quarantine behavior.

## 10.6 — Performance / robustness

- Profile hot paths before optimization.
- Add focused stress/regression coverage for any Phase 10 behavior that can affect playback or graph publication.
- Do not trade callback safety for UI responsiveness.

## 10.7 — Release-quality closure

- Cross-workflow polish and production golden-path validation.
- Full Linux / Windows / macOS production CI plus core and legacy regressions.
- Final audit of architecture, realtime safety, project compatibility and documentation before Phase 10 is marked DONE.

## Invariants

- Production desktop path remains **JUCE 9.0.2**.
- Project format begins Phase 10 at **v11** and remains v11 unless a specific approved feature genuinely requires persisted schema state; any migration must retain backward loading.
- Audio callback: no filesystem access, locks, logging, UI calls, plugin scanning/instantiation or new dynamic-allocation work.
- Project edits remain control-thread operations that publish realtime-safe state.
- PRs stay small and scoped; CI must be green before merge.
- Phase 11 does not begin until the Phase 10 final audit is complete.

## Current checkpoint

Completed in `main`:
- **10.1.1** stable Arrangement selection and predictable click-to-select behavior.
- **10.1.2** bounded multi-selection with Ctrl/Cmd-click toggling and one-transaction multi-selected Delete.
- **10.1.3** horizontal navigation, bounded zoom and 1/16 musical snapping with Alt-drag free placement.

This branch implements **10.1.4 — manipulation feedback and Undo/Redo robustness**:
- Active clip/Pattern drags show a vertical position guide plus Bar/Beat and SNAP/FREE feedback.
- Project publication now asks Arrangement to resynchronize its index-based interaction target from the persistent selection IDs.
- Undo/Redo and any whole-Project replacement cancel stale drag state, clear an invalid primary selection, clamp the viewport and repaint safely.
- Existing move, Delete, Duplicate and Pattern-repeat edits continue to commit through the existing UndoStack; no project schema change is introduced.
- All of this remains UI/control-thread work; the realtime audio contract is unchanged.

After this PR and its parent are green and merged, **10.1 Arrangement editing is DONE**. The next planned block is **10.2 — Mixer production workflow**.
